#UAV-EDGE-DRL

This repository contains a modular implementation of the Deep Q Learning algorithm with multiple modifications:

 - Simple or Prioritized Experience replay.
 - Boltzmann or epsilon-greedy Policy.
 - Double DQN (DDQN) and Target DQN.
 - Dueling Q Networks and simple Q Network.
 - Polyak update (soft updating) or periodic update.

It is implemented in a modular fashion so that the developer can choose the combination of componentes that better fits its needs.
